# PKGBUILD scripts of GNOME stack

This is a repository of PKGBUILD scripts for *most* components of GNOME
Project, including GNOME Shell, GTK+, and low-level libraries. With the 
exception of GTK+, most PKBUILD scripts point to master branches of 
various components of GNOME Project. All scripts are adapted from official
scripts from Arch Linux's official repositories and AUR.

*Most* of the scripts can build successfully. However, I don't make 
guarantee that they will definitely build in the future.
