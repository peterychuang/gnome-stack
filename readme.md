# PKGBUILD scripts of GNOME stack

This is a repository for storing the PKGBUILD scripts of *most* of the
GNOME stack, including Shell, GTK+, and low-level libraries. With the 
exception of GTK+, most of the PKBUILD scripts point to master branches
of various components of GNOME Project. All scripts are adapted from
official scripts from Arch Linux's official repositories and AUR.

*Most* of the scripts can build.
